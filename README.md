## Wireframe

- Since we are building a game for the terminal without GUI or deployment on a website, this is the visual you'd expect for the user:
![wireframe](https://i.ibb.co/fN2DVJJ/chess-board.png)


## Domain Model
![domain_model](https://i.ibb.co/WDwDGhY/1.jpg)

- The first method called is init, inside the chess board is built and colored black and white.
    - init is called by creating an object of the ChessBoard class.
    - It does not return anything (None).

- The second method called is render, it is called by an object of the ChessBoard class, it will use matplotlib to draw the board and show it to the user.

- The add_red and add_blue methods are responsible to assign the chess pieces to the location provided by the user as input, it colors the square on the board and then calls the method render to update the view to the user.

- The main method holding most of the functionality to the user is the under_attack method. It calculates the coordinates of the pieces relating to each other and prompts the user when one of his/her pieces are being under possible attack by the other team.
    - This method is called after every call to add_red or add_blue.


## Database
- In our project, live – chess game, using database is not a basic requirement. However, we might set using a data base for storing players information/credentials,
 chess moves and final score as a stretch goal.
 -  For now, data will be stored in local variables in the code.

## Cooperation Plan

- **What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**
 
Aseel -> Good analytical skills and conceptual thinking.

Hamzh -> Good debugging skills.

Hisham -> Good planning skills and strategic thinking.

Reema -> Good organizational skills.

Yahya -> Good trouble shooting skills and positive energy.

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

Having team members with good planning, strategic thinking and organizational skills will empower our team to have an efficient project plan especially in the early stages.
Also, having members with good analytical skills will help us define our problem domain and to visualize the parts of the solution beforehand, and to provide the best strategy to handle the problem.
Finally, having members in our team with good debugging and trouble shooting skills will help us solve errors/bugs in a timely manner and contribute to better optimize the solution.

 
- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

We have room to improve ourselves in time and task management also in decision making relating to choosing the most convenient algorithm and in our testing skills.

We plan on scheduling stand up meetings daily to divide the tasks and responsibilities for each team member, review previous work and also discuss any challenges we face.



## Conflict Plan

- **What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

Firstly after meeting in a zoom call were all team members are present we will look for the branch with the issue and compare the last commit with the current work and decide on which parts to keep and which to remove.

- **What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

We will have an internal meeting to discuss the matter in a diplomatic way ensuring the any misunderstandings are resolved with minimal damage. If we failed to solved internally, we'll probably ask the instructional team for advice. 

- **How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

Communication is key when it comes to team work, we agreed on a strategy that ensures all team members are on the same page, by adding clear docstrings to each function and explaining it to the team by the responsible person.

- **How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

During our daily meetings, we will make sure to communicate with members not contributing enough, and discuss possible working solution, as to overcome the issue.

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

If the conflict was not solved internally, we will escalate the conflict by reaching out the instructional team for help, support and advice.
